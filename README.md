## NUCLEO_G474RE_FW_Study_1

This repository contains my personal learning of the Udemy course “Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)”, originally provided in C.
I converted what I learned from the course into both C and C++ versions, based on the NUCLEO-G474RE. The development tools I used are STM32CubeMX and CLion.
